## üß≠ Tasks Summary

### Task 1: Introduction

Brief overview of the AD room. No questions.

### Task 2: Windows Domains

* A domain is a central management system for users/computers.
* AD runs on Domain Controllers (DCs).
* Centralized identity + security policies.

‚úÖ **Answers:**

* `Active Directory`

### Task 3: Active Directory

* Key components: Users, Machines, Security Groups.

* Organizational Units (OUs): Containers for users/devices.

‚úÖ **Answers:**

* `Domain Admins`
* `TOM-PCS`
* `Organizational Units`

```powershell
Set-ADAccountPassword sophie -Reset -NewPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString)
Set-ADUser -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true -Identity sophie
```

* Created separate OUs for `Workstations` and `Servers`.
* Moved computers accordingly.

‚úÖ **Answers:**

* `7`
* `yay`

### Task 6: Group Policies

* Group Policy Objects (GPOs) define configuration rules.
* GPOs created under Group Policy Management.

gpupdate /force
```

## üèÅ Final Flag

**Completion Trigger:** Room fully completed after finishing all tasks.

## üß† Key Takeaways

* Active Directory is the heart of Windows domain networks.
* Organizational Units (OUs) allow structure and control.
* GPOs help enforce security and configuration.
* Kerberos is a secure authentication protocol; NetNTLM is less secure.
* Trees/Forests and trust relationships scale AD across enterprises.
